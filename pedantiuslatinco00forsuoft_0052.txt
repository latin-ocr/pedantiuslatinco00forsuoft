Nash ridicules the couitier- airs Harvey gave himself when the

Queen was at Audley End.

«Ι haue a tale at my tungs end.. .of his hobby· horse -reuelling
and domineering at Audley End when the Queen was there3 to
which place Gabriell (to do his countrey more worship and glory)
came ruffling it out huffty tuffty, in his suite of veluet. There be

them in Cambridge that had occasion to take note of it ε for he Α

stood noted, or scoared·, for it in their bookes many a faire day
after >³ ¹

« There did this our Talatamtana, or Doctour H um, thrust himselfe
into thickest rankes 'of the N oblemen and Gallants, and whatsoeuer
they were arguing of, he would not misse to catch hold of, or strike
in at the one end, and take the theame out of their mouthS‚ or it
should goe hard. In selfe same order was hee at his pretie toyes and
amorous glaunces and purposes with the Damsells‚ & putting
baudy riddles vnto them. In fine, some Disputations there were
and he made an Oration before the Maids of Honour... » 2

The proces of that Oration was of the same woofe and thrid
with the beginning : demurely and maidenly scoffing‚ and blush-
ingly wantoning & making loue to those soft skind soules δι
sweete Nymphes of Helicon betwixt a kinde of carelesse rude
ruffianisme and curious finicall complement : both which he more
exprest by his countenance than anie good jests that he vttered.
This finished... by some better frends than hee was worthie of,
and that afterwards found him unworthie of the graces they had
bestowed vpon him, he was brought to kisse the Queenes hand
and it pleased her Highnes to say (as in my former Booke I haue
cyted) that he lookt something like an Italian.

No other incitement he needed to rouze his plumeS‚ pricke up
his eareS‚ and run away with the bridle betwixt his teeth, and
take it vpon him... but now he was an insulting Monarch aboue
Monarcha the Italian that ware crownes on his shooes : and quite
renounst his naturall English accents and gestures δε wrested
himselfe wholy to the Italian puntiliOS, speaking our homely Iland
tongue strangely, as if he were but a raw practitioner in it, and
but ten daies before had entertained a schoolemaster to teache him
to pronounce it. Ceremonies of reuerence to the greatest states (as 1t
were not the fashion of his cuntray) he was very parsimonious and
niggardly of and would make no bones to take the wall of Sir
Philip Sidney and another honourable Knight (his companion) about -
Court yet attending... is Haile fellow well met with those that
looked highest... follows the traine of the delicatest fauourites and
minions... ³.
