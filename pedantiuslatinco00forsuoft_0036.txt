The character of the cloth· merchant had appeared in Reuchlin's

But when all this is said, it remains true that no single play or
story has been found which can be called the source of our comedy,
not even by Creizenach who in his Geschichte des neueren Dramas
shows so wide a knowledge of dramatic literature and a particular ·

acquaintance with our play, or at least with the abstract of it given
by Churchill and Keller.
But if in default >of further researchv we are left without any

 

foreign source for our play, we shall not, Ι think, jump to the
conclusion that our authors had nothing before them to work on.
On the contrary Ι think the play itself contains evidence that it is
of the nature of a sequel to a play— no doubt a Latin play —
which had been previously seen by the same audience.

ln the first scene Crobolus (described 1n the argument as « olim
servus Chremuli› 2‘) 1s giving a lesson to his servant Pogglostus how
to treat him in his new role of a master. Chremulus, at the time
the play opens, is dead. There would appear to be no reason for
mentioning him unless he is a character already known. And how
much more point the first scene gainS‚ if we suppose that in it
Crobolus is no new character, but one known to the audience
previously as a slave!

But there is more than this. 1³4³de in the past he
haCLEfi-lmed his pupil Leonidas against love. Leonidas plays
no part in this play: but he is represented as being now in an
influential position at Court. Yet he is spoken of as though the
audience knew already much about him 2. Ι am persuaded then
that Pedantius had been preceded by a comedy much nearer to
the Plautine and earlier Italian type, in which the chief role was

played by a young man LeonidaS, the son of ChremuluS‚ who
