mine told me so.
Bob. By the life of Pharaoh, and't were my case nowe, I

a most desperate thrust, beleeue it.
Mat. Well, come sir.

545 Bob. Why you do not manage your weapons with that fa-
’ cilitie and grace that you should doe, Ι haue no spirit to play
with you, your dearth of iudgement makes you seeme tedious.

Mat. But one veny sir.
