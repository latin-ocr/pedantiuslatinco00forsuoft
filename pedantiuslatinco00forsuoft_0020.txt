you laye no wager at all, Ile fetch him alost in PedantiuS, that exquis-
ite Comedie in Trinitie Colledge ; where vnder the cheife part, from
which it tooke his name, as namely the concise and firking finicaldo
fine School-master, hee was full drawen δε delineated from the soale
of the foote to the crowne of his head. The iust manner of his phrase
in his Oratione and Disputations they stufft his mouth with &
no Buffianisme throughout his whole bookeS, but they bolsterd out
his part with ε as those ragged remnaunts in his foure familiar
Epistles twixt him and Senior Immerit0‚ raptim scripta, Nosti manum
(55, stylum, with innumerable other of his rabble-routs ε and scoffing
his Musarum Lachrymae with F lebo amorem meum, etiam Musarum lach-
rymis : I leaue out halfe : not the carrying vp of his gowne, his
nice gate on his pantoffleS, or the affected accent of his speach‚ but

'2 they personated. And if Ι should reueale all, I thinke they 'borrowed ,

’ his gowne to playe the Part in, the more to flout him ».

According to Nash, then, whose account is corroborated by what
we find in Pedantius‚ the publication of Harvey's F camiliar Epistles
in the early summer of 1580 was followed in succession by a time
during which he was in concealment, by a return to Cambridge, by
a short period du1 mg which he was Secretaiy to a protecting Lord,
(probably Lord Leicester), by his dismissal from that post, and by
the appearance of Pedantius. Pedantiu3‚ then, (which, as we shall see,
has undoubted allusions to the F amiliar Epistles) according to Nash
was brought on the stage six months at least after their publica-
tion : but as Nash never states that he was himself in Cambridge

s t the time, he leaves us to gather that it was acted before Octo·

1 81 1582 when Nash matriculated at St John'S. The period then in
which Pedantius aerd, according to Nash, was somewhere
between the mel-of 15803011 the summer of 1582

“’ Combining this iesult with that previously arrived at, Qe led
to expect that the play was brought out between the winter of 1580
an.d July 1581, and probably 111 the< ⁴,Candlemas Τ81111 », the ordinary
time for the production of College plays.

F tis interesting therefore to find that the Junior Bursar’ s Book
of Trinity College¹ under the date 6 Feb. 1580s1 has the entry:

(ε Item layde out for the playes sexto Februarij
vli xnus v111d 00. >>

Ι have little doubt myself that that sum of Ξ 5. 145. 8 ¹l2 d defrayed
the productiori of Pedantius on 6 February 1580s1.

the vice-Master.
