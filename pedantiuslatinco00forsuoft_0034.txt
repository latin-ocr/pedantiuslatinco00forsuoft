vpon euerie stage, hee hath been brought for a Sicophant and a
Sowgelder [i-e. a fool] υ ¹. But as Nash tells us that the three
brothers Harvey were ridiculed at Clare Hall in a show called
« Tarrarantantara turba tumultuosa Trigonum Tri-Harveyorum,
Tri· harmonia 2> ² we cannot be sure that in the former passage he
means to imply that Pedantius itself had been acted on every stage

- , in Cambridge.

In an account of Lord Essex’s « device before the Queen >2 3 given
on the 17 November, the « Queen’s Day 2³, 1595, Rowland Whyte
writes to Sir R. Sidney : ‹< Thold Man was he, that in Cambridg
plaied Giraldy, Morley plaied the Secretary, and he that plaied
Pedantiq [at C ?] was the Soldior... >³ 4.

Is this a ¹reference to a performance of Pedantius at Cambridge?
If so, it was probably a performance much more recent at the time
Whyte was writing than the original performance of 1581. It is
probable however that our play is not in question here, and that
<c Giraldy υ and t< Pedantiq >1 were characters in some other comedy
recently acted at Cambridge.

We have already quoted Cooper’s account of the acting of a
play called Pedantius in 1602 in which the chief part was taken by
Walter Hawkesworth. But assuming that Cooper had some ground
for his statement, itis possible (though not likely) that this was a
new play. ι

How far was our play known outside Cambridge before it was
printed in 1631? It is a question not easy to answer. Nash’s words
in Strange N ewes (1593) (ε This I will iustifie against any Dromidote
Ergonist whatsoever » ⁵ might lead one to think that, « Dromidote >³
had become a popular expression for a scholastic logician. N ash
may, however, have been writing for the benefit of Gabriel Harvey
