Preface.

I desire to express my hearty thanks to my friend and colleague‚
Professor W. C. Summers, of University college, Sheffield, for the ·
valuable help I have received from him on many occasions in deter-
mining on particular readings of the text and in tracing Classical quota-
tions'.

The Notes show that I have been supplied with many interesting
illustrations of the language of the play by my friend, Professor E.
Bensly of Adelaide —- and I would here thank him for them. ,

Imust also acknowledge help received from our most learned and
revered Professor of Latin at Cambridge, the Rev. J. E. B. Mayor, from
Dr Adam of Emmanuel College. from the Rev. Dr H. P. Stokes‚ and
Mr R. B. Mc Kerrow‚ of Trinity College.

I would finally acknowledge with gratitude the assistance I have
derived alike in my Introduction and in my Notes from the History (ff the
