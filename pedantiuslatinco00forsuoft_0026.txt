and of the commendatory letter of Whitaker's work, — even certain
coincidences of phrase with our play ¹ —they connect themselves at
the same time with the man 01 affairs whose life we have traced‚ in
that the author 01 1116 second is described as <c Esquire >³ and
expressly stated to be a Justice 01 1116 Peace 2.

Edward F orsett married (apparently about 1585) Elizabeth‚ daugh-
ter of Robert Carr of Hillingdon‚ MiddleseX. By her he had a son
Robert and a daughter FranceS‚ wife 01 Matthew Howland (after-
wards knighted), besides other children. These latter as well as
his wife were already dead, when, having settled his « lands of inher-
itance » 011 his son Robert and resigned to him the manor-house 01
Marylebone, Edward Forsett died early in 1630 at the age of 78. His
will made 13 Oct. 1629 when he was living at« Charinge Crosse
howse», was proved 25 May 1630. In it he directed that he should
be buried in the vault he had made in Marylebone Church 3.

We see that both Wingfield and Forsett satisfy all the require·
ments which we should expect in the author of PedantiuS. Both were
young fellows 01 Trinity, in residence in 1581 — both were men 01

bet -— the last word probably a mere misprint — (To the Reader.Cp.Ped.

2) Anthony A’ Wood, who knew nothing 01 0111 Cambridge Edward
Forsett, wrongly attributes both these books to an Edward Forsett 01
1116 family 01 the Forsetts 01 Billesby, Linconshire‚ who was matricula-
ted at Lincoln College‚ Oxford on 19 Nov. 1591. (Athence ΙΙ 5).

3) This church was pulled down in 1741. Lysons' Environs ofLondon tells
us that the Forsett vault was indicated by some rude verses : —

These pewes unscrud and tane in sundir,
In stone thers graven what is undir :
To wit, a valt 101 burial there is
Which Edward Forset made for him and his.

journal.
