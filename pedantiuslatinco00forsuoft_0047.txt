quaeSQ ille est ἲ n - and said that he had already t< vultus Itali
habitusque viri 2). In the same* poem Harvey introduces the prover-

bial line t< Cum fueris Romae, Romano vivito more » and the phrase ,

« dies... niveo signanda lapillo 2³. In another poem « De Osculo »
he celebrates his being allowed to'kiss the Queen’s hand, while in
another, « De Aulica », he speaks with enthusiasm of the ladies of
the court, whom he now met probably for the first time. He uses
the conventional language of flattery in speaking of Elizabeth z —
« Regia Diva 2), « Dea »‚ c< Viva dea est» διο. He again uses the old
tag <c Si qui filius albae Gallinae fuit 23. He has the phrases « fac ad
portas adstare Britannas Hannibalem » and « cogit amare Iecur n.
At this time Harvey’s fellowship at Pembroke was about to
expire and a letter was written to the Master by Lord Leicester
asking that it might be extended for a year longer. The Master
supported Leicester’s request ² but it was not acted upon by the
Fellows and Harvey ceased to be fellow. However on 18 Decem·
ber following he was elected to a fellowship at Trinity HaIl, a col·
lege which as the home of Law was specially congenial to one who
was proposing to make the Civil Law his life-study. Apparently
Harvey did not go abroad on Lord Leicester’s service, as he
expected ; at any rate not at this time. In the autumn of 1579 and
the spring of 1580 he was exchanging with Spenser the letters
which were published in 1580 as Three Proper and ,Wittie familiar
letters (preface dated 19 June 1580) and Two other very commendable
letters, written before the others, though published after them.

In a letter written from «Trinitie Hall, 23 Oct. 1579» we find ,

Harvey still expecting to go abroad. <c I hope by that time I haue
been resident a yeare or twoo in Italy, I shall be better qualifyed
in this kind ». At this time Spenser himself was apparently about
to travel on Lord Leicester’s service, as we gather from his letter
to Harvey of 7 October written from <t Leicester House ».

In the winter of 1579-80 Spenser’s Shepherds Cdlerzder appeared,

⁴ - ushered into the world by a mysterious ‹< E. K. >›, generally identi-

fied withEdward Kirke, who had been a friend of Spenser’s at

Pembroke Hall. While Spenser himself under the name « Imme-
rito» dedicated the work to Philip Sidney, « Ε. Κ. >> added an
introductory letter «to the most excellent and learned both orator
