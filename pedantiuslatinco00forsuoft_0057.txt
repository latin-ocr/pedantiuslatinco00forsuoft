Letters were one of Harvey’s most admired and most read books :
his copy, full of marginalia, is in the British Museum). When he
begins to quarrel with Dromodotus, he taunts him ‹< Non est oratio
tua calamistrata ; tractas argumenta illotis manibus, scilicet,
sermone Duncico ac Dorbellico n. We remember the last phrase in
Harvey’s Rhetor 1. .

When Dromodotus refers to Lydia's refusal of him, Pedantius
replies : ε( At illam ego nunc ducam (vel dijs hominibusque invitis)
etenim urgebo illam ligeris regijs mqssfljlssfflijs ». It was no unusual
event in the 16th century for the University or a College to find
itself deprived of its right of electing its own officers by receiving a
«mandatory letter» from the crown instructing it to appoint a
particular person ². Harvey himself in 1585 was the victim of this
practice, when after being elected Master of Trinity Hall, he found
- his election quashed and a rival put in his place by a royal letter
mandatory. But we have seen that Harvey had been himself not
indisposed to bring externa] influence to bear upon the university
in his own favour. He had invoked Lord Leicester when he was
about to lose his Pembroke Fellowship ; he had invoked Lord
Burleigh in the contest for the Public Oratorship which was not
settled when the play was produced. It was, therefore, not without
a persona] reference, that Pedantius was made to say that he
yvould overcome Lydia’s resistance, if necessary, by a royal letter

mandatory in his favour.
In Scene ΙΙΙ Pedantius uses Harvey's favorite tag c< Suadae me-

dulla ». He is still on his rhetorical stilts. There is a strong flavour
of Harvey about the peroration : « Quis in Grammatica congruus?
Nonne >Pedantius ? Quis in Poetarum hortis floridus ? Nonne
Pedantius? Qui 5 in Rhetorum pompa potens? Nonne Pedantius ἓ» ³

Pedantius tells Lydia of a new career which he sees before
him z« Pedantius tuus...in strepitu forensi versabitur generosissime:

1) Cp. Pierce's Supererogation (Grosart II 246) ε ε( Foole and dolt and ideot
and Dunse and Dorbell» quoting Nash’s terms of abuse.

2) 111 March 1578l9 the University had complained to Burghley of the
recent frequency of letters mandatory for the admission ot Fellows and

ScholarS. Cooper's Annals II, 368.

¹ 3) Compare Pierces Supererogation (Grosart II, 176) « What the saluation

of Dauid Gorge? anullitie : what the deification of N. H.? a nullitie:

what the sanctification of Browne ? a nullitie 3 what the communitie of
ἐ Barrow ? a nullitie : what the plausibilitie of Martin ? a nullitie».
