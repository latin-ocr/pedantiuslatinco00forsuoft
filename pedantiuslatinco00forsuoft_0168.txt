Notes,

copperplates of Pedantius aud Dromodotus.

The artist’s name is not given. The portraits are in the manner
of Thomas Cecil or William Marshall. If the portraits were
executed for the publication of the play in 1631, it would seem
that the dress was made to belong to a rather earlier period.
Dromodotus’ legend Videtur quod sic is a phrase characteristic
of scholastic disputation : cp Pedantius 1. 1930, 2836 n. Simi-
larly Pedantius’ legend As in Praesenti is a tag characteristic
of the grammarian. Lily’s Grammar (De Latinorum nominum gene-
ribus, de verborum pratentis &c, Basss, 1532) has on p. 28 v : « leielmi
Lilii de simplicium verborum pmtaritz's — Prima coniugatio — As
in praesenti perfectum format in aui ».

Pedantius’ portrait shows his books standing, as was usual in old
libraries‚ with the edges of the leaves in fiont, and the titles
inscribed on thern. The books again are characteristic of the
schoolmaster-rhetorician : two volumes of Cicero, Nizolius (cp
Ped. 793), Calepin (cp 2485), Cato's Distycha (quoted 2065, 2084,
2637, cp. 2586 n) and Floras Poetarum (cp 1996).

As has been stated in the Introduction (p xvii), this portrait since
the latter half of the 18th century has been repeatedly said to
represent Dr Thomas Beard of Huntingdon. But no good evidence
of this is given. The raison d'e‘tre of the portraits of Pedantius and
Dromodotus is the fact that the 1630 edition of Ignoramus con-
tained a portrait of the hero of that piece (also with a shelf of
characteristic books), and all three portraits are no doubt
equally imaginary. ‘

Pedantius de Se. These lines were of course written in connexion
with the publication of the printed play in 1631. From the corn-
parison drawn between this play and Ignoramus (in which Rosa-
bella figures) we conclude that it was the success lately achieved
by ignoramus in printed form which led to the printing of Pedan-
tiuS. The play Ignominia& written by Geo. Ruggle‚ F ellow of
Clare Hau, was acted before King James I on 8 March and
13 May 1615, but was not printed till 1630, when it was putforth by

J John Spenoer, London‚ with an imaginary portrait of Ignoramus
as a frontispiece. A second edition appeared before the end of
the year.
