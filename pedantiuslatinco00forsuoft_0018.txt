Here Dromodotus’ speech, omitted in C, leads up to Ludio'S,
which in C comes in abruptly.

We find, then, that P certainly, and C with much probability,
differs from the original form of the play and neither is a certain
authority for correcting the other. Even if it were otherwise, it
might perhaps be argued that when a play has been acted repeat-
edly, and revised for each new performance, any one form has the
same interest as any other: and it would be pedantic to attach
particular importance to the form in which it left the hands of its
original authors. As things are, I have taken as the basis of this
edition the P text, making only such corrections as seemed neces-
sa1y to clear it of obvious errors z and even such corrections I have
seldom made without having the authority of C for doing so.
Meanwhile all variants are given in the Textual Notes which follow
the text.

II. DATE OF THE PLAY.

In determining the date of the composition and first perform-
ance of Pedantiu8‚ we are assisted first of all by the following note
appended by Sir John Harington to the 14th Book of his translation
of the Orlando F urioso (1591) ε ’

« In the description of Discord and Fraud and finding Silence
in the House of Sleep being long since banished from philosophers
and diuines, the allegolie is so plain, as it were time lost to spend
time to expound it— only Ι will obserue one thing 1n Which mine
Author is thought to keep an excellent Decorum. [Pon making
Discord and F raud of the feminine gender, he still makes Silence
the masculine‚' as the like pretie conceit is in our Cambridge
Comedie Pedant‘ius (at whiche I remember the noble Earle of Essex
’ that now is, was preses—{Dathere the Pedantius himselfe, examining
the gramaticall instruction of this verse ε Cedant arma togae, concedat
laurea linguae‚ vpon special] consideration of the two last words,
taught his scholler Parillus ¹ that laurea, lingua sunt utraque foemininae
[sic] generiS, sed lingua potissimum, and so consequently silence might
not by any meanes haue bene of the feminine gender ».

Harington’s words « at whiche I remember the noble Earle of
Essex that now iS,was present » tell us a great deal.Hawkins ² remark-
ed on them « he does not mention in what year », but he tells us
more than Hawkins apparently saw.

1) One wonders if Harington himself played this part.
