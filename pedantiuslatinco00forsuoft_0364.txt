[10 j Euery man in his Humor.

190 Now (by our Ladies blessed sonne) Ι sweare‚
Ι rather thinke him most infortunate,
In the possession of such holy gifteS,

Being the master of so loose a spirit.
Why what vnhallowedfuffian would haue writ,

195 With so prophane a pen, vnto his friend?

The modest paper eene lookes pale for griefe

To feele her virgin-cheeke defilde and staind

With such a blacke and criminall inscription.

Well, Ι had thought my son could not haue straied,
200 So farre from iudgement, as to mart himselfe

Thus cheapely, (in the open trade of scorne)

To geering follia, and fantastique humour.

But now Ι 566 opinion is a foole,

And hath abusde my senceS. Museo,
205 < Enter M usco,

Mus. Sir.
Lor.se. What is the fellow gone that brought this

letter?
M πε. Yes sir, a prettie while since.
210 Lor.se. And wher's Lorenzo?

M us, In his chamber sir.
Lor.se. He spake not with the fellow, did he?

Mus. No sir, he saw him not.
Lor.se. Then Museo take this letter, and deliuer it vnto Lo·

215 remo: but Sirra, (on your life) take you no knowledge Ι haue
open'd it.
M τις. O Lord sir, that were a iest indeed. Exit Mus.
Lor.se. I arn resolu’d I will not crosse his iourney.
Nor will Ι praetise any violent meane,
220 To stay the hot and lustie course of youth.
For youth restraind straight growes impatient‚
And (in condition) like an eager dogge,
Who (ne're so little from his game withheld)
Turnes head and leapes vp at his masters throat.
225 Therefore ile studie (by some milder drift)
