found himself dismissed and his hopes of a' career at court disap-
pointed.

Nash then proceeds to his account (already quoted, p. IX) of the y

peerance of PedantiuS, which, as we have argued, took place on

6 February 1580s1, at a time when Harvey and Anthony Wing- ξ
field were at the height of their contest for the office of Public ’ ¹

Orator, unless the result was already a foregone conclusion.

So far, we have sketched Harvey’s life up to the time of the per-
formance of Pedantius by way of preparation for our examination
of the play. Before we proceed to it, however, we will give a few
more passages from Nash, which must be‘taken as showing the
light in which Harvey appeared to those of his contemporaries who
were disposed to be hostile to him.

Nash in Strange N ewcs comments on his persona] appearance and
manners. He calls him ‹< Timothie Tiptoes », « this Asse in presenti,
this gross painted image of pride, >› he laughs at his « Pumps and
Pantofles » ¹ he touches on his « well pruned paire of moustachios, »
and his beard, « a prety polwigge sparrowes tayle peake. >›

In Have with you to Saffron Walden (1596), Nash returns to the
charge. Harvey (ε looks like a cas of toothpikes or a lutepin put in
a sute of apparell. >› N ash traces his career from his youth upwards‘
and gives a description of him professedly from the pen of his
college tutor. This gentleman is made to touch on his Cicero-
nianism: « if you heard how sacredly he ends every sentence with
esse posse videatur you would forget you are mortall and imagine
youre selfe no where but in Paradice. >› The tutor continues ε -

<c he is... distractedly enamourd of his own beautie spending
a whole forenoone euerie day in spunging and licking himselfe by
the glasse : and vseth euerie night after supper to walke on the

, market hill to shew himselfe, holding his gown vp to his middle

 

that the wenches may see what a fine leg and a dainty foote he
hath in pumpes and pantoffles and if they giue him neuer so little
an amorous regard, he presently boords them with a set speach of
the first gathering together of societies and the distinction of amor
and amicitia out of Tullies Offices 2. »

object any certaine vice against me, but onely one greuous crime called
Pumps δε Pantofles (which indeed I haue worne euer since I knew Cam-
bridge)... and Pride. ›>
