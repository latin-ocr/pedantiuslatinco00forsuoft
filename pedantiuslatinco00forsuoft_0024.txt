Researches at the Record Office, London‚ in which the chief work
has been done for me by my friend Mr G. J. Turner of Lincoln's
Inn, editor of «Select Pleas of the Forest» for the Selden Society,
have enabled me to see in the above F orcets the three eldest sons
of Richard Forsett of Gray’s Inn and Margaret (name unknown)
his wife — and in consequence 10 11300 1110 13101 031001 of Edward
Forsett with comparative certainty.

WhenForsett left Cambridge in 1581, it was probably to enter in-
to the Queen’s service. Forsett’s connexion with Lord Essex, then a
ward of Lord Burleigh, would probably make this easy for
him even if he had had no family interest at court. But that he had
such interest seems clear from the terms of the will of his father,
Richard F orsett, « made the XV daye of July in the 3rd yere of the
raigne of our soueraigne ladie Quene Elizabeth» (i. e. 1561). The
will contains the following curious clauses ε t< Item I giue and
bequeath to the right honorable William Cecil knight υ (i. e. the
future Lord Burleigh) « Ξ 20 of lawful money of EngIand, desir-
ing his honorable mastershipp of his goodness to take my eldest
son John F orsett into his seruice if he shall think him so entred in
lerning that he may be meete for his seruice. Item I doe bequeath
to Mr Gerrard the queens majestys general attorney one of my
three eldest sonnes and Ξ 6. 13. 4 of lawfull money of England
with him and he shall take his choice of them at his pleasure. »
It is clear from this that both Lord Burleigh and Sir Gilbert
Gerard were under a moral obligation to do something for one
of Richard Forsett’s sons — and as Edward was the only son whom
we know to have entered the public service, we may conclude that
he did so under Lord Burleigh's or Gerard's patronage.

Though we hear nothing of him in this connexion during the
reign of Elizabeth, we find from the State Papam, Domestic Series that
on 19 May 1609 « Edw. F orsett » reports on α inconveniences likely
to ensue in the Office of Works from refusal of the paymasters to
comply with the regulations 2), that on 20 May 1609 there is a warrant
to pay him Ξ 200 for repairs about Oatlands Park, and on 1 May
1610 there is the entiy t< Edw. Forsett and Simon Basill to Salisbury.

appear that the Office of Works with which Forsett was connected
was located in the Tower, for we find Edw. Forsett and John
