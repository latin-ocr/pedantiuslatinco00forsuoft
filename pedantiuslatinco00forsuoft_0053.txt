Nash. tells how Harvey in later years being always short of
money would put off a creditor with fine speeches :

« as soone as euer his rents came vp, which he expected euerie
houre... [he said] he would most munificently congratulate, corres-
pond and simpathize with him in al interchangable vicissitude of
kindnes 3 & let not the current of time seeme too protractiue,
extended, or breed any disunion betwixt them, for he would acce-
lerate & festinate his procrastinating ministers and commissaries
,in the countrey‚ by letters as expedite as could be. I giue him, »
Nash adds, t< his true dialect and right varnish of elocution, not
varying one I tittle from the high strains of his harmonious phrase,
wherein he puts down Hermogenes with¹ his Art of Rhetorique and
farre... outstrips ouer-tunged beldam Roome » ²,

Nash says that Harvey does not greatly difies from the Usher of ·

a dancing-school, that his complexion is

« of an adust, swarth, chollericke dye like restie bacon or a
dride scatefish : so leane and so meagre that you wold thinke... he
obseru'd 4 Lents in a yere ε for his stature he is such another
pretie I ack a Lent as boyes throw at in the streete : a smudge
piece of a handsome fellow it hath beene in his dayes, but now
he is olde and past his best : his course of life is such as would
make anie man looke ill on it, for he wil endure more hardnes
than a Camel >› ³.

« Sir Philip Sidney... held him in some good regard and so did

most men3 & (it may be) some kinde letters he writ to him to ’

encourage and animate him in those hopeful courses he was entred
into ; but afterward, when his ambitious pride and vanity, vnmaskt
it selfe so egregiously, both in his lookes, his gate, his gestureS‚
and speacheS, and hee would do nothing but crake and parret it in
Print in how manie Noble-mens favours he was... then Sir Philip
Sidney... began to looke askance on him, and not to care for him,
though vtterly shake him off- he could not, hee would so fawne
and hang vpon him >2 4.
