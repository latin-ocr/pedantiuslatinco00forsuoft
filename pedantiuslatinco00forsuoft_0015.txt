V

Here the editor of Ρ, taking occasion of the mention of Diogen-
eS‚ has substituted a joke on dolium and dolorzficum for a sentence
of C, with the result that the next sentence, « ut probem etc ³> is no
longer led up to, but appears as an abrupt transition.

If there were any doubt that C has here the original form of the
passage, it would vanish on the consideration that the words Nosti
manum (δ’ stylum followed by raptim are parodies of Gabriel Harvey
, and indicated as such by Nash in his reference to the play 1. In the
P form the word raptim disappearS.

P therefore has additions not in the original text : and probably
the majority of the pedantic passages which occur in· P and not in
C are of this character.

P also has omissions of original passages ε

1) Nash’s spelling Dromidote also supports the C text, which has Dro-
midotus, not Dromodotus. On the other hand Harington’s Pedantius agrees
with the P text, C having Poedantius.
