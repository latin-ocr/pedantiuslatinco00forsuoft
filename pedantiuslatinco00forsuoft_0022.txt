XII

25 Oct. 1569, a student of Gray’s Inn 1572, scholar of Trinity 1573,
B. A. 1573l4, minor fellow 1576, M. A. and major fellow 1577. s
For some time he was Reader in Greek to the Queen. In March
158ol1 he defeated Gabriel Harvey at the election to the office of
Public Orator of the University. In 1582-1583 he was Senior Proc-
tor and during the latter part of his year of office, owing to the
death of his original colleague, had Gabriel Harvey as Junior
Proctor. He held the College offices of Senescallus (Steward) 1583,
Thesaurarius Junior (Junior Bursar) 1585, Pandoxator (Supervisor
of the Butteries) 1586, and became Senior Fellow in 1587. In 1588
he ceased to be Fellow and next year reSigned the Oratorship of
the University.

He seems to have left Cambridge in order to try his fortune in ἱ
high places and to have met with little success. We find him
writing on 18 Dee. 1598 to Sir Robert Cecil1 that he had often,
when Public Orator at Cambridge, addressed his illustrious father
in Latin letters and now having left academie fountains where
things were pleasant and prosperous he has endured the hardships
of the sea of a court and only through Cecil’s help has escaped ship-
wreck. Soon after this, he seems to have become tutor to two young
CavendisheS‚ holding his post till 1609 when he was succeeded by

sthe famous Thomas Hobbes, He apparently died about 1615.

Itis stated that Latin letters by Wingfield are to be found in
Epistoloe Academiae ΙΙ, 468 and a copy of Latin verses by him in the
University collection of verses on the death of Sir P. Sidney. An
epigram The Peer Content is given in Lodge's I llustrations ΙΙΙ, 176.

Edward Forsett, (of whom Messrs Churchill and Keller say that
« nichts weiter bekannt ist >›²) having been matriculated from Christ's
College on 22 Feb. 1563l4 became Scholar of Trinity in 1571, B. A.
1571l2, fellow of Trinity 1574, M. A. 1575. In 1577 when Lord
Essex went to Cambridge, Forsett had rooms contiguous appa·
rently to those of Lord Essex and his tutors. For among Lord
Essex’s expenses « at his entrance in the chamber at Cambridge υ
of which a record is kept in Lansdowne MSS. 25. f. 46„ we' have
a 0011005 entry relating to the making of a door between Forsett’s
rooms and those of Gervase Babington, another Fellow of Trinity
