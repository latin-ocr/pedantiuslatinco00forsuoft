The subsequent letter to Spenser is dated « nono Calendas

After these various poetical specimens (some being by his
brother John), Harvey adds « Raptim uti vides »‚ and at the end of
a postscript to his letter « Nosti manum ὃν stylum. G ».

These Three proper... letters were probably published by July
1580. According to Nash the lines on the Italianate English· ⁴
man were taken by Lord Oxford as a satire upon himself, and
Harvey had to suffer for them. If so, it was probably in 1580 after
their publication in the letters (Nash indeed says so), for though
Harvey a year earlier seems to reproach Spenser for having
already published his t< Verlayes >2 without his consent 1, if the
<c Speculum Tuscanismi » had brought him into trouble then, he is
not likely to have republished it a year later.

The story of the offence taken by Lord Oxford and its conse-
quences to Harvey is only known to us on the authority of Nash,
who relates ² that Harvey had to lie perdu for eight weeks in the
house of a nobleman (whom we presume to have been Lord Lei-
cester) : that Sir James Croft ferreted him out and had him put in
