Ϊ, An edition in quarto, dated the following year, was printed ‹< for Walter
s Burre ». Of this 3 numbemf copies are extant. 'l'he present reprint has been
22²³ prepared from 3 transcript made from the copy preserved in the Bodleian
Library‚ Oxford, and the proofs have been read throughout with a copy in
¹ the British Museum. This copy bears the press-mark C. 34· c. 59.; there is
also another copy, of which use has constantly been made for purposes os
comparison, with the press-mark 162. c. 70. So far as has been observed the
. copies of the original quarto agree absolutely. The reprint in the Shake-
› = speare-Jahrbuch XXXVIII has also been consulted3 it proves to be not in-
f variably accurate in detail.
In the present reprint the original has been reproduced as faithfully as
ἕῇρο551010. All misprint have been retained, including turned letters and
τ, &wrong founts. The spacing has, of course, necessarily been normalised,
&though the division of words has in 311 cases been preserved. In the
³ κ’ punctuation the roman and italic founts have been carefully distinguished
⁴ >except in the case of commas, which expericnce has shown to be practi-
cally impossible, while the attempt is ruinous to the eyesight. A certain
, number of black-letter 510115, mostly queries and periods, appear in the
τ’ origina13 these have been treated 35 10111311.
The lines have been numbered throughout and correspondence with the
³ text of the 1616 folio (M aterialien, VII) noted in the right hand margin.
Readers are requested to correct the following errors, which have unfor-
ι v: ¹tunately crept into the reprint :

, ἔ 1. 2150 for Gui. read Giu.
