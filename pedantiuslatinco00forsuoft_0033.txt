superficial censures taxe the exercises performed in their colledgeS,
as these acted on our publicke stages, not looking into the true
and direct use of either, but ambitiously preferring their owne

presumptuous humorS, before the profound and authenticall judge-
ments of all the learned-Doctefsefthe Universitie ».

The excellence of t'he acting of college playes in attested in a

L'atin letter of a foreigner, William Soonc ¹, of 1575 thus translated
in Cooper’s Annals of the University : Ι

‹< In the months of January, February and March to beguile the
long evenings they amuse themselves with exhibiting public

plays which they perform with so much elegance, such graceful
aetion and such command of voice, countenance and gesture that

if Plautus, Terence, or Seneca were to come to life again, they
would admire their own pieces and be better pleased with them
than when they were performed before the people of Rome, and

EuripideS, Sophocles and Aristophanes would be disgusted at the
performance of their own citizens ».

It will be seen that Soone speaks of the Lent or Candlemas term
as that in which plays were acted. We are therefore not surprised
to find that in 1581 the Trinity plays were given — not as the
statutes ordained — in the twelve days of ChristmaS, but on the
6 February. ’

From what has been said we can ’ imagine the scene when
Pedantius Was presented. The College Hall was no doubt packed
with spectators — chiefly, we may presumo, from the College itself,
which in 1573 had 380 members in residence -- but it included
some from without the college, for John Harington of King’S, the v
Queen’s godson, was there ; and possibly Robert Greene of Clare
Hall and Kit Marlowe of Benet’s ². And no doubt the rumour that
ΜΓ Harvey of Trinity Hall was to be satirized would make many
older members of the University eager to see the fun.

How often after this occasion Pedantius was acted in the Univer-
sity we do not know. Nash tells us (speaking of Harvey) ε t< better
acted than he hath been at Cambridge, hee can neuer be ε where

²) Greene after his travels abroad is thought to have resided at Cam-
bridge from 1580 till he took his M. A. in 1583. (His name however does
not occur in a list, preserved in Lansd. MSS 33.43 of members of the
University in residence in November 1581). Marlowe, though he did not
matriculate till 17 March 1580l1, must have been in residence at Corpus
a year earlier, as he took his B. A. degree in 1582l3.
