’ Euery man in his Humor. [21]

As fearing to abuse your patience,
585 But that Ι know your iudgement more direct,
” Able to sway the nearest of affection.
Giu. Come, come, what needs this circumstance?
Tho. I will not say what honor I ascribe 655
Vnto your friendship, nor in what deare state
5oo I hold your loue; let my continued zeale‚
The constant and religious regard,
That I haue euer caried to your name,
My cariage with your sister, all contest,
How much I stand affected to your house.
³ 595 Giu. You are too tedious, come to the matter, come to the
matter.
Tho. Then (without further ceremony) thus. 661
My brother Prospero (I know not how)
Of late is much declin’d from what he waS‚
‚ 600 And greatly alterd in his disposition.
’ When· he came first to lodge here in my house,
Ne're trust me, if I was not proud of him:
Me thought he bare himselfe with such obseruance,
ι So true election and so faire a forme:
605 And (what was chiese)1t shewd not borrowed in him,
ι But all hedid became him as his owne‚
ἰ4 And seemd as perfect, proper, and innate,
Vnto the mind, as collor to the blood,
But now, his course is so irregular,
¹ 610 So loose affected, and depriu'd of grace,
And he himselfe withall so farre falne off
From his first place, that scarse no note remaineS,
To tell mens iudgements where he lately stood;
Hee's growne a stranger to all due respect,
615 F orgetfull of his friends, and not content
To stale himselfe in all societieS, ῃ
He makes my house as common as a M art,
A Theater, a publike receptacle
For giddie humor, and diseased riot,
