strange sights we haue seene in our dayes, (I or nights eyther) to come
to me to Florence this day. Go to, you shall come, and let your

Well‚ it is the strangest letter that euer I read.
Is this the man, my sonno (so oft) hath prays'd
To be the happiest, and most pretious wit
That euer was familiar with Art?
