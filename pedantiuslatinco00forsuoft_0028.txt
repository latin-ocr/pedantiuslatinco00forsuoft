are copied, not only by N oble, but by A. Bromley in his Catalogue
of Engraved British Portraits 1793 p. 84 and by B. Brook Lives of the

- Puritans 1813 vol. II p. 396, while J. S. Hawkins in his edition of

I gnoramus 1787 p. 249 makes the same statements on the authority
of Noble ¹. What ground Granger had for either statement I have
not discovered. ’

That Dr Beard was the author of Pedantius has no sort of proba-
bility. He was not of Trinity College in thefirst place, but of
Jesus ε he took his Β. Α. degree in 1587l8 and his M. A. degree in
1591, that is, in the very year in which Harington wrote that he
remembered the play to have been witnessed (apparently years before),
by Lord Essex :and if he had been the author of the play, it is
extremely unlikely that he' should have· been caricatured in the
person of his own butt, PedantiUS, when the play was printed in
1631 -- yet the latter statement rests on the same authority as the
former.

In spite however of the strong evidence and strong probabilities
which connect the play with Wingfield, or Forsett, or both of
them jointly, and the utter groundlessness of its ascription to
Beard, it is a remarkable fact that up to now the catalogues of
our great libraries (that of the Bodleian is a praiseworthy excep-
tion) almost all treat Pedantius as the work of Beard, Even the
Dictionary of National Biography in speaking of the play under
« Anthony Wingfield »tells us that Beard's claim is a stronger one.

How then can Beard's name have come to be associated with the
play? My own theory is that some one saw rightly or wrongly in
the portrait of Pedantius a resemblance to Beard, who survived .
at Huntingdon till a year after the play had appeared in print, and
who would probably a few years later come to be hated by Royal-
ists as the schoolmaster of Oliver Cromwell. The name of Beard
having acquired this connexion with the play, it only needed a
rather more than ordinary confusion of mind to say that he was
the author. The persistence of this legend is only another proof

¹) The author of the article on Latin Plays in the Retrospective Review
XII asserts —- no doubt carelessly —that the figure of Dromodotus prefix-
ed to the play is said to represent Beard. It is noteworthy that the
Biographia Dramatica of Baker-Reed-Jones (1812) calls α Μ. Wingfield »
«the reputed author n of Pedantius and knows nothing of Beard in this

connexion.
