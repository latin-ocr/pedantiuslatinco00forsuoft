XLIX

agree very well with the picture Nash draws of Harvey’s impecu-
niosity. There is however a similar scene with a draper 1n Reuch-
lin' s Henn01 ,and 1n the Return from Parnassus Part Ι Act ΙΙ So Ι we

have a Draper and Taiffirlimflssbrmmplmmng-QQ University

customers 2. This last scene may of course have been suggested by -
Pedantius.

Similarly the lesson to Parillus (Act VfVSc ΙΙ) is part of the Δ

traditional machinery of schoolmaster plays and must'not be taken
as an attack on Harvey's scholarship.

There is however —- as Nash stated —- a direct reference to Har-
vey’s F amiliar-Letters in the eloth-merchant’s question (Act V Sc ΙΙΙ)
ε( Nosti manum ἃ stylum hunc ? >³ and Pedantius’ reply (in the
Caius MS only) « Raptim scripta >² — just as the passage in Act V
Sc VI when Pedantius declares he will write a tragedy on his
unhappy love and adds « nuncupabo autem, LACHRYMAS
MUSARUM » (so printed in 1631) is a direct reference to Harvey's
elegy on Sir Thomas Smith 3.

There are personal allusions a little later which are perhaps
beyond our power of explaining to the full. Pedantius is urged to
return to the University on the ground that since his departure
« non est ulla reperta res qua suffulciantur Ciceroniani >›‚ and he
replies 2'« Redeam? Non si me tota Academia vestra humeris suis
reportaret. Ego hactenus in hoc Tusculano meo n, (the phrase by
which Harvey in his F amiliar... letters spoke of his home at Saffron
Walden) ‘« & in negocio fui sine periculo & in otio cum dignitate.
Artes enim nobiscum et peregrinantur δε rusticantur : de illis ac
de me ipso cum cogit0, venit in mentem mihi quod de Hannibale
referunt historiae : Vincere scis Hannibal, vti victoria nescis : Sic illi in
eligendo me, prudentes erant, in dimittendo plus quam stolidi».
The words have no relation to anything told us of Pedantius, and

1) Herford. Lit. relations (ff England and Germany in X VI th century, p. 80.

2) Cp. also Chapman’s May Day Act II (towards the end).

3) The fact that <c Lachrymas Musarum » is here printed in capitals‚
and the words « speculum Tuscanismi »‚ « vultu Itali» 11. 1469, 1470 sup.
are printed -in italics‚ seems to me sufficient proof that the editors
of the play in 1631 were fully aware of its references to Gabriel Harve y,
in spite of the words of their introductory verses : « Dum ludor, non
ludo graves, non laedo Scholarchas »‚ on which Messrs Churchill and
Keller have laid stress. However, even if the editors slavishly followed
a manuscript which they did not understand, their ignorance is of no
weight as against N ash’s statements and what we find in the play.
