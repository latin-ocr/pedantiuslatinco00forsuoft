College plays were acted with much splendour. This is seen by
a letter written by Rog'er Ascham from Antwerp on 1 Oct. 1550 to
his friend Edward Raven‚ Fellow of St John's College, in which
Ascham tried to give Raven some idea of the magnificence of Ι
Antwerp by saying that it surpassed all other citieswhich he had
visited as much as the hall of his college when decorated for a
play at Christmas surpassed its appearance at ordinary times ¹.

Included among the Parne Papers in Trinity College Library
are some accounts of the year 1555 for repairs to properties for « the
Master’s show» (probably a play by J. Christopherson, then Master
of the College). These properties include aSPS, crocodileS, a sceptre
⁴ etc.

The following letter 2 from the Master and Seniors of the
College forty years later shows at once the official character
which the college plays still retained and the importance attached
to their worthy representation.

« To the right honorable... the Lo : Burghley...

From the following entries in the Junior Bursar’s Book of
Trinity College for the year 1578-1579‚ we gather that performances
of college plays (especially perhaps if the plays had the same satiri·
cal character as Pedantius) sometimes excited the angry passions
of persons not admitted to witness them.
