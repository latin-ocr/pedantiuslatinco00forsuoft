that a lie dies hard. If it is now scotched, we have performed a
service for which no one would have been so grateful to us as

Dr Beard himself.
In The Theatra of Gods Judgments — of which a 3rd edition

appeared, like PedantiuS‚ in 1631, —· Dr Beard writes in the true

Puritan vein ¹ :

’ <c It resteth now that wee speake somewhat of Playes and Come-
dies, and such like toys and May-gameS, which haue no other vse in
the world but to depraue and corrupt good mannerS‚ and to open
a doore to all vncleannesse 3 the eares of young folke are there pol-
luted with many filthy and dishonest speecheS, their eyes are there
infected with lasciuious and vnchaste gestures and countenanceS,
and their wits are there stayned and embrued with so pernitious
liquor that (except Gods good grace) they will euer sauour of it ».

And he goes on to tell us with approval that among the Romans

« the masterS‚ guidem, and actors of Playes were always debar-
red as men infamous from bearing anie publike Office or dignitie
in the Commonwealth. >›

Is it not an insult to the man who wrote those words to suppose
that - even in his salad days — he had been himself the author <
of a comedy?

Cooper in his Athenae Cantabrigienses (II 441·2) assigns Pedantius to
aiom-th claimant, Walter Hawkesworth of Trinity College, B. A.
1591l2 ². It is clear that Cooper was forgetful of the mention made of
Pedantius by Harington in 1591 and by Nash in 1593 when he could
write as follows :

<c At the Bachelor’s Commencement 160213 the Latin comedy of
Leander was acted at Trinity College for the second time, and
another comedy‚ which he (i. e. Hawkesworth) had himself written,
entitled PedantiuS‚ was produced for the first time. He represented
the principal characters in both these dramas 22.

Cooper’s statements are repeated by Hawkesworth's biographer in
the Dictionary of N ational Biography, who indeed slightly improves
on his source by speaking of Pedantius as a comedy « which he is
known to have written >³

It is quite clear that if the Pedantius said to have been played in
1602s3 was the play which we possess both in print and in MS, the
