[46] Euery man in his Humor.

could say what I know of the vertue of it, for the exposing of
rewmes‚ raw humorS, cruditieS‚ obstructions‚ with a thousand
of this kind; but I professe my selfe no quack-saluer: only thus
1480 much: by Hercules Ι doe holde it, and will affirme it (before
any Prinoe in Europe) to be the most soueraigne‚ and pretious
herbe, that euer the earth tendred t'o the vse of man.
L0.2'u. Oh this speech would haue done rare in a potheca-

1485 Pis. I: close by Saint A nthonies: Doctor Clements.
Enter Piso and Cob.
Cob. Oh, Oh. · 1596
Bob. Where’s the match Ι gaue thee?
Pis. S'blood would his match, and he, and pipe‚ and allwere
1490 at Sancto Domingo. Exit.
Cob. By gods deynes: I marle what pleasure or felicitie' they
haue in taking this rogish Tabaeoo: it's good for nothing but
to ohoake a man, and fill him full of smoake‚ and imbers: there
were foure died out of one house last weeke with taking of
1495 it, and two more the bell went for yester-night‚ one of them
(they say) will ne're scape it, he voyded a bushell of soote ye-
ster-day, vaard and downeward. By the stockes; and there
were no wiser men then Ι, I'ld haue it present death, man or
woman, that should but deale with a Tabacco pipe; why, it will
1500 stifle them all in the'nd as rnany as vse it; it’s little better then

rats bane. Enter Piso,
All. Oh good signior; hold, hold.
Boh. You base cullion, you. 1610 ἓ

Pis. Sir, here’s your match; come, thou must needes be tal-
1505 king too.
Cob. Nay he wil not meddle with his match I warrant you:
well it shall be a deere beating, and I liue. -

Bob. Doe you prate?
Loa‘u. Nay good signior, will you regard the humor of a

1510 foole? away knaue.
Pros. Piso get him away. Exit Piso, and Cob.
