scholarly attainments — and, if we are right in fixing the first per-

formance as having taken place on 6 Feb. 1581, Wingfield was at Ι
the moment engaged in a contest for an academica] office against -

Gabriel Harvey. The play emanated from a set of Trinity men,
whom that contest had stimulated to make a butt of Harvey.

Probably more hands than one were engaged on it. Whether the
main author was Wingfield or Forsett, we cannot say. The fact
that Wingfield's opposition to Harvey was notorious may well have
led Nash to think of him in connexion with the play. On the other
hand as F orsett left Cambridge in 1581 and would probably soon
afterwards be forgotten there, it is likely that the association of his
name with Pedantius was a very early one and so deserving our spe—
cial consideration. On the whole we shall probably be right if we
attach more weight to the anonymous scribe of the Caius Ms. and

assign Pedantius to Edward F orsett.

Ἴ Two other names have been associated with the authorship of
Pedantius.

Noble in his Memoirs of the Protectoral House of Cromwell 1784
(vol. I p. 323) has the following confused passage, in which he
attributes Pedantius to Dr Thomas Beard, Oliver Cromwell's Hunt-
ingdon schoolmaster.

s

« Dr Beard is author of « Pedantius... 1631 n.. he in part was ·

author of the Theatra of Gods Judgments‚ in the frontispiece of which
is a neat whole-length print of him with two scholars standing
behind him, a rod in his hand and as in praesenti appearing from his
mouth. >2

Noble therefore states (1) that the copperplate of Pedantius pre· ,

fixed to the play represents Dr Beard, (2) that the play was also
written by him : but he appears to be under the impression that the
portrait is prefixed, not to the play, but to Dr Beard’s authentic
work, The Theatra of God's Judgments, (1597).

Noble’s statement is manifestly based on a hasty reading of J.
Granger's Supplement to Biograplzical History of Englcmd 1774 p. 201,
where Granger, after describing the figure of the schoolmaster
prefixed to Pedantius in the same terms as those used afterwards by

Noble, and stating it to be a portrait of Dr Beard, goes on to say ’

that Dr Beard was author of t< Pedantius... 1631 >³ and adds <c The
print of him belongs to this comedy ³). Granger's statements that
Pedantius was written by Beard and the cut was a portrait of Beard
