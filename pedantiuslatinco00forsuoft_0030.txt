play, that is, known to Harington and Nash, Walter Hawkesworth
was not its author. It is at the same time possible that he adapted
it for its new use, perhaps by adding the many (though unimpor-
tant) interpolations which distinguish the printed ⁴text of 1631 from
the Caius MS. ’ ᾗ

Β111 what was Cooper’s authority ? Was ⁸ it merely a chance
remark of Cole's? For Cole in his notes for his proposed Athenae
Cantabrigienses (Add. Mss. 5871 p. 102), after attributing to Walter
Hawkesworth the play LabyrinthuS, adds the wordS‚

If this vague suggestion of Cole’s is all that Cooper’s statement
rests on, we have once more exposed a myth.

IV. PERFORMANCES OF PEDAN TI US.

s,
The first performance of Pedantius took place, as we have argued,

on 6 February 1581 — and no doubt in the Hall 01 Trinity College.
Mr J. W. Clark tells us 1 that

(ε Queen Elizabeth's statutes given in 1559-60 [the College had
'been founded in 1549] prescribe the annual performance of plays in
the hall during the twelve days of Christmas under the direction
of the nine lecturers (lectores). The head-lecturer (primus lector) is
10 represent either a comedy or tragedy ε 1116 remaining eight are
to divide four plays among 1116111, 6111161 comedies or tragedies,
one of each being entrusted to two lecturers. The performances
may be public or private. If these directions be not carried out,
each lecturer who is to blame is to pay a fine of ten shillingS. Plays
were accordingly performed in the hall of Trinity College for a
x considerable number of years, as shown by the entries in the
Audit-Book, but towards the end of the seventeenth century they
were given up. »

The old Hall 01 Trinity occupied the site 01 1116 present combi-
nation 100111, buttery and kitchen. The 110111 01 11 011 ‚the ⁸Great
Court was still preserved after the construction of the present hall
in 1604 and it is to be seen in Loggan’s plan of the college. The Old
Hall, according to Μ]Γ Clark, was* about 52 feet long by 25 broad,
nearly corresponding therefore in its dimensions to the present hall
of Peterhouse. It had the 50166115, butteries and kitchen at its

north end 2.
