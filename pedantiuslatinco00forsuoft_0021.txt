Ι may add one other point which would confirm this conclusion.
Pedantius asks (l. 371) : « Vt valent sodalis nostri Academici ?
Numquid adhuc conlyenit inter vos & oppidanos? >³ The words
seem to imply a rec-ent. ..disag'reerpmentfflbetween the University
and the authorities of the town of Cambridge. If we turn to Hey-
wood and Ἦῐῖξῖιῒέ U niversity Transactz'ons (II. ⁴ 264 and 288) we find
that in the spring and summer of 1580 there were two serious dis· Vs
putes between the two bodies, If Pedantius was produced, as Ι have
argued, early in 1581, it is quite natural that it should contain some
reference to these recent occurrences.

One may also observe that Legge’s play of Richardus III which
precedes Pedantius in the Caius MS was acted at St John’s in 1573
or 1579, and that Bellum Grammahcale, coupled with Pedantjus by
Harington in his Apology prefixed to his Orlando Furioso, («(*How
full of harmeles myrth is our Cambridge Pedantius! andthe Oxford
Bellum Grammaticale! ») was written apparently at quite as early a
, date.

III. AUTHORSHIP.

An investigation into the question of authorship confirms the
result already arrived at.

Two statements in regard to the authorship of Pedantius are
worthy of serious consideration ε

Α priori one would assume that the author of a play acted in
Trinity College would be a member of the College, probably ayoung
Fellow‚ or at least a graduate. The two ascriptions now to be men·
tioned alike satisfy this expectation. ’

The Caius MS. describes the play as c< PaedantiuS, Comoedia...
authore ΜΓΟ Forcet n.

Nash in Strange Ναῖος 1 speaks of « M. Winkfields Comoedie of
Pedantius in Trinitie College n.

In spite of a ridiculous misunderstanding which with some read·
ers converted <t M. [i.e. Mr] Winkfield 2> into (ε Matthew Winkfield »
(or Wingfield)² there is no doubt about the person whom Nash
had in his mind.
