of the> same standing as himself, who became in time a Bishop ¹.

F orsett, like Babington, vacated his F ellowship at Michaelmas n

1581.
This is without doubt the <t ΜΓ Forcet ³> to whom the Caius scribe

attributes the authorship of PedantiuS.

It is interesting to note that if the attribution of the play to
= Forsett is correct, we have in this another ground for fixing its
date. It would have been unlikely that Forsett should have had a
hand in it, if it had been produced after the summer of 1581 when
F orsett was no longer in Cambridge.

Before closing the account of F orsett’s Cambridge career, it
should be mentioned that he was the author of a long commendatory
γ letter in Latin headed t< Edouardus Forcettus Cantabrigiensis Lec-
tori S. D. >³ which is appended to the Latin translation by W. Whita-
ker of a work by Bishop Jewel, Ioannis Ι uelli.. Adversus ThomamHar-
dingum volumen alterum, Londini 1578. Whitaker‚ then a Fellow of
Trinity about five years older than Forsett, was a divine of immense
learning, a moderate Puritan, and recognised as the champion of
English Protestantism against Bellarmine. It says much, therefore,
for Forsett’s reputation as a scholar and a serious man that as a
layman of five and twenty he should have been asked to contri-
bute the first and most important of the commendations accom-
panying Whitaker’s work. In the letter he writes as a convinced
Protestant and patriot and denounces the « homines Angloloua-
nienses qui maluerunt Louanii potius venenum exitiale dirumque
perpotare quam saluberrimum gustare succum Angliae vereque
profecto lac maternum. » How little did he foresee the time when a
new race of « <homines Anglolouanienses ›> would give to the ‘world
a second edition of PedantiuS. t

It has been said that Edward Forsett had been matriculated as a
member of Christ’ s College on 22 Feb 1563s4. The University Matri-
culation Book among the students of Christ's College-of that date
contains the series of names t< Forcet W„ Forcet Hen. imp. ² (11),
Forcet Edw. imp. (10) » The number in a bracket gives the age.
