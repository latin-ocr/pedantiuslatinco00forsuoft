First of all, the words «Ι remember»‚ « the noble Earle of
Essex that now is » clearly imply that the performance in question

But further. Harington implies that not only Lord Essex but he
himself was 'present at the first performance of the play. At what
time do we know Harington and Essex to have been in Cam-
bridge together ?The answer is — during their student years,
Essex at the age of 10 entered Trinity College in May 1577, he
was matriculated 1 July 1579 and took his M. A. degree on
6 July 1581. Harington matriculated as a· fellow-commoner of
King’s College¹ on 8 Dec. 1576, obtained his B. A. as « filius nobi·
lis » by special grace in 1577l8 and took his M. A. degree (no doubt
remaining in residence till that time), like Essex, in 1581.

a satire on Gabriel Harvey‚ and he speaks of it in connexion with Ι
a period of Harvey’s life which would coincide with the period ¹
mentioned above.

Nash tells us that in consequence of an offence given to a noble-
man in one of Harvey's Familiar Epz‘stles (published in June or
July 1580) he had to lie perdu for 8 weeks in a nobleman’s house,
that Sir James Croft ferreted him out and had him put in the Fleet

sent back to Cambridge. He there gave himself great airs and led
people to believe that he was destined for speedy preferment at
court. To court he returned, but behaved so ridiculously that his
patron advised him to return to his studies and sent for another
