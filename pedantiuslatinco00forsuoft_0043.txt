The last statement, in our belief, is put far too strongly ¹, but,
whether that be so or nc, we may remark that the intentioris of
the author of Pedantius were not necessarily patent to his editor
of fifty years later, and that a more minute examination of the
play than Messrs Churchill and Keller had time for, brings us to a
conclusion very different from theirs.

In the Pedantius of the play we see unmistakeable references
throughout to traits of Gabriel 'Harvey's character or incidents in
⁵ his life. In some cases the incidents are known to us independently,
in others they are known only from Nash's own account of Harvey,
which in itself is, of course, hostile and open to suspicion. But we
maintain not only that Nash spoke the truth when he said that in
this play Harvey was t< miserably flouted at 2³, but also that the
general truth of Nash's account of Harvey's life gains fresh support
from the allusions we find in Pedantius.

Let us first recall some facts and impressions of Harvey’s early life.

Gabriel Harvey was born in 1550 or 1551 ², as the son of a rope-
maker of Saffron Walden, a little town fifteen miles from Cambridge
over the Essex border. He matriculated at Christ's College, Cam-
bridge, on 28 June 1566. It seems likely from expressions used by
Harvey in later years, that during 1569 and 1570 he was holding
one of the scholarsh‘ips at Christ’s just founded by Sir Walterv
Mildmay. If that was so, his acquaintance with Mildmay may have
been a stepping-stone to his obtaining the protection of Lord
Leicester, which we find him enjoying some years later. Harvey

took his BA. degree in 1569l7o and his Μ.Α. degree in 1573. In -

November 1570 he had become a Fellow of Pembroke Hall.

At Pembroke he found Edmund Spenser, a year or two younger
than himself in age, (he was born apparently in 1552), and three
years junior in university standing (he had been admitted a sizar of
Pembroke in 1569, became BA. 1572l3 and M.A. 1576). Whether
Spenser had already published poems at this date, we may leave
undetermined ; at any rate his poetica] genius was no doubt
already apparent, and between him and the young Fellow of his
College, a man with a thirst for learning and every kind of great-
ness, a warm friendship quickly sprung up.

the Athenaeum, 4 Dec. 1903.
