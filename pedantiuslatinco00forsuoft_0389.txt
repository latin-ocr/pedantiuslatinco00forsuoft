Euery man in his Humor. [35]

Bob. Why atthe beleagring ofGlzibellett0‚where, inlesse then
two houreS‚ seuen hundred resolute gentlemen‚ as any were in
1085 Europe, lost their lines vpon the breach: ile tell you gentlemen‚
it was the first, but the best leaugre that euer I beheld with these
eyeS, except the taking in of Tortosa last yeer by the GenowayeS,
but that (of all other) was the most fatall &dangerous exploit‚
that euer Ι was rang'd in, since I first bore armes before the face
' 1090 of the enemy, as I am a gentleman and a souldier.
Step. So, Ι had as liefe as an angell I could sweare as wellas 1196
that gentleman.
Laiu. Then you were a seruitor at both it seemes.
, Bob. Oh Lord sir: by phaeton Ι was the first man that entred
s* 1095 the breach‚ and had Ι not effected it with resolution, Ι had bene
’ slaine if I had had a million of liueS. ’
L0.z·u. Indeed sir? > (like you him?
, Step. Nay & you heard him discourse you would say so: how
Bob. Ι assure you (vpon my saluation) 'tis true, and your
' 1100 selfe shall confesse. ,.
’ Prosp. You must bring him to the racke first.
Bo& Obserue me iudicially sweet signior: they had planted
me a demy culuering, iust in the mouth of the breac'h3 now sir
(as we were to ascend) their master gunner (a man of no meane ,
1105 skill and courage, you must thinke) confronts me with his Lin-
„ stock ready to giue fire; Ι spying his intendement‚ discharg’d
my Petrinell in his bosome, and with this instrument my poore ’

⁵ Rapier, ran violently vpon the M oores that guarded the ordi-
ζῖ nance, and put them pell-mell to the sword.
1110 Pros. To the sword? to the Rapier signior. 1217

L0.z·u. Oh it was a good figure obseru'd sir: but did you all
this signior without hurting your blade.
Bob. Without any impeach -on the earth: you shall per-
. ceiue sir, it is the most fortunate weapon‚ that euer rid on a
1115 poore gentlemans thigh: shall Ι 1011 you sir, you talke of M or-
³ glay, Excaliber, Durindana‚ 01 50; 1111, Ilend no credit to that is
reported of them, Ι know the vertue of mine owne‚ and there-
fore Ι dare the boldlier maintaine it.

E 4. Step.
