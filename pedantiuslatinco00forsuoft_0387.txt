Euery man in his Humor. [33]

thee: Sirra these be they two Ι writ to thee of, nay what a drow-
sie humor is this now? why doest thou not speake?
LoJu. Oh you are a fine gallant, you sent me a rare letter.
PrOS. Why was’t not rare?

1015 L0.I u. Yes ile be sworne I was ne're guiltie of reading the 1121
like, match it in all Plinies familiar Epistles, and ile haue my
iudgement burnd in the eare for a rogue, make much of thy
vaine‚ for it is inimitable. But I marle what Camell it waS, that

had the cariage of it? for doubtlesse he was no ordinarie beast
1020 that brought it.

Pros. Why?

L0.Iu.1Why sayest thou? why doest thou thinke that any
reasonable creature, especially in the morning, (the sober time
of the day too) would haue taine my father for me?

1025 Pros. S'blood you iest I hope?

LoJu. Indeed the best vse we can turne it too, is to make a
iest on't now: but ile assure you, my father had the prouing of
your copy, some howre before Ι saw it.

Pros. What a dull slaue was this? But sirrah what sayd he

1030 to it yfaith?

LoJu. Nay I know not what he said. But I haue a shrewd 1136
gesse what he thought.

Pro. What? what?

LoJu. Mary that thou art a damn’d dissolute villaine,

1035 And I some graine or two better, in keeping thee company.

Pros, Tut that thought is like the Moone in. the last quar-
ter, twill change shortly: but sirrha, I pray thee be acquainted
with my two Zanz'es heere, thou wilt take exceeding pleasure
in them if thou hearst them once, but what strange peece of

1040 silence is this? the signe of the dumbe man?

LoJu. Oh sir a kinsman of mine, one that may make our
Musique the fuller and he please, he hath his humor sir.

Pros. Oh what ist? what ist?

Lo. I u Nay: ile neyther do thy iudgement, nor his folly that

1045 wrong, as to prepare thy apprehension: ile leaue him to the
mercy of the time, if you can take him: so.
E 3 Pros.
