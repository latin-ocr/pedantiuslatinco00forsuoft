priuatly vaunted what redoubled rich brightnes to his name this
short eclipse had brought and that it had more dignified and raisd
him than all his endeuours from his childhood. With such incre-
dible applause and amazement of his Iudges hee bragd hee had
cleard himselfe, that euery one that was there ran to him and
embrast him and shortly hee was promist to be cald to high prefer-
met in court, not an ace lower than a Secretariship‚ or one of the
Clarks of the Councell. Should I explaine to you how this
wrought with him and how in the itching heate of this hope-
full golden worlde and hony moone the ground would no longer
beare him, but to Sturbridge Fayre ¹ and vp and downe Cambridge

on his foot-cloth maiestically he would pace it, with manie moe ⁴

madde trickes of youth nere plaid before ; in stead of making his
heart ake with vexing, Ι should make yours burst with laughing.
Doctor Peme in this plight, nor at any other time, euer met him,
but he would shake his hand and crie Vanitas vanitatum, omnia
muita& Vanitie of vanities and all things is vanitie.

His father he vndid to furnish him to the Court once more,
where presenting himselfe in all the colours of the raine-bow, and

⁶ a paire of moustachies like a black horse tayle tyde up in a knot,

with two tuffts sticking out on each side, he was askt by no meane
personage, Unde haec insania ? whence proceedeth this folly or
madnes ? & he replied with that wether-beaten piece of a verse out
of the Grammer, Semel insaniuimus omnes ², once in our dayes there
is none of vs but have plaied the ideots ε and so was he counted
and bad stand by for a N odgscombe. He that most patronizd
him, prying more searchingly into him, and finding that he was
more meete to make sport with, than anie way deeply to be
employd, with faire words shooke him of, & told him he was fitter
for the Vniversitie, than for the court or his turne, and so bad God
prosper his studies, and sent for another Secretarie to Oxford >³ 3.

This seems to imply that in the late autumn of 1580 Harvey was

4) That Harvey was for a time at court under Leicester's patronage is
clear from Spenser's Colin Clout's come home again, where after Colin Clout
has been inveighing against the Court, Hobbinoll (Harvey) retorts
(1. 732) :

t< Ah Colin‚ then said Hobbinol‚ the blame
Which thou imputest is too generali

For well I wot sith Ι my selfe was there

To wait on Lobbin (Lobbin well thou knewest) 2).

Lobbin is undoubtedly Leicester. See Shepheards Calender XI, 113,
note by E. K. « Lobbin, the name of a shepherd‚ which seemeth to
have bene the lover and deere frende of Dido 22. -
