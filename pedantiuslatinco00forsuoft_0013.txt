, forty years,
according to its editors, more probably fifty years, after it was
first acted. It had been licensed by the Stationers' Company on the
9ῐ11 February 1630 (1631). It appeared as a duodecimO, with the
titlepage, the copper plates of Dromodotus and Pedantius, the
introductory verses by the editors, the Personae, Argumentum and
the concluding list of Erratula corrigenda headed Fabulam lecturo

given in this volume. As will be seen, the book gave no indication
of its authorship. This text will be called henceforth P.

Two MSS. of Pedantius exist, one in the Library of Caius College
Cambridge, one in that of Trinity College. The Caius MS. 62 (for-
merly 125) is of the 16th or 17th century and contains three plays,
Legge¹s Richardus III, Hymenaeus (without a title) and after them
Pcedantius comoedia acta Ι in collegio Sanctoe et Ι individuae Trinitatis Ι
authore M ΥΟ Ι F orcet. This text, which is written in a beautiful hand,
will be henceforth called C. -

The Trinity College MS R 17 (9) also includes PedantiuS. This

ἵ , text seems not to differ from C and is apparently a copy of it, made

— to judge from the writing — in a hasty and perfunctory manner. ι

No further attention will be paid to it.

We have now to consider the relation in which P and C stand
to each other.

The two texts differ from each other both by omission and addi-
tion on either side :and it can be shown that neither is in al] points
nearer to the original form of the play than the other.

Many differences between them are mere re-arrangements of the
words forming a phrase, the substitution of o'ne word for a syno-
nym‚ or the expansion of a brachylogy.
