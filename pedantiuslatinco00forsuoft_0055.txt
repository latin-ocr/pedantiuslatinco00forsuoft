dangerous societyof ladies of the court. In the last speech given to
·Pedantius in the scene we see a parody of one of Harvey’s favourite
tricks of rhetoric z « vt nihil dicam de...‚ vt taceam..., vt praeter-
eam..., quid attinet dicere de... silebo etiam..., quid comme-
morem... Ρ» ’

In „the next scene Pedantius usesa favorite grammar-book quo·
tation of Harvey’s, t< non omnibus dormio. >› Characteristic of a
rhetorician is Pedantius’ delight in seizing on an opportunity for
declamation : « Sed video iam ‘campum in quo exultare possit
oratio.

In Scene ΙΙΙ, - just as Harvey is said to have discoursed to young
women in the Cambridge marketplace on the distinction of amor
, and amicitia in Cicero's De qfficiis‚ - Pedantius addresses Lydia in
a Ciceronian sentence concluding with an esse posse videantur : and
’“ he keeps the oratorical strain during the scene. When Lydia is
proof against all, we have the reaction of wounded vanity : <c Non
