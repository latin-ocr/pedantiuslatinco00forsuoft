Ρ REF ACE.

’ Ι cannot send this edition of Pedantius into the world without
returning my thanks to all who have assisted me in the course of
my work. Among these Ι must specially mention my friend
Mr G. J. Turner of StJOhn's College, Cambridge, and Lincoln's
Inn, thanks to whose legal knowledge and acquaintance with the
documents contained in the Record Office it was alone possible
to re-construct the history of Edward Forsett and his family3
Dr J. S. Reid, F ellow and Librarian of Caius College, who most

readily gave me valuable help of various kinds ; Mr Aldis Wright, ’

Vice-Master of Trinity College, Dr Henry Jackson, Mr Ε. Harri-
son, and Mr W. W. Rouse Ball, Fellows of Trinity College,
Dr Peile, Master of Christ's College, and ΜΓ R. F. Scott, Fellow
and Bursar of St John's College. I would also include some kind
correspondents to N otes and Queries; and, last but not least, Profess-
or Bang, who has given himself endless trouble in fulfilling his
high conception of the duties of General Editor, and at whose

- suggestion I undertook this particular piece of work.
