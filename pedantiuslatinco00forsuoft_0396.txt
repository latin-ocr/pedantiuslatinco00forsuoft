[42] Euery man 1111115 Humor.

For feare Ι sinke, the violence of the streame
Alreadie hath transported me so farre,
1335 That I can feele no ground at all: but soft, Enter Cob.
Oh it's our xvaterbearer: somewhat ha’s crost him now. . ¹
Cob. F asting dayes: what tell you me of your fasting dayes? F
would they we're all on a light fire for mee: they say the world Act.
shall be eonsum’d with fire and brimstone in the latter day: but
1340 I would we had these ember weekeS‚ and these villanous fri-
daies burnt in the meane time, and then—
Pis. Why how now Cob, what moues thee to this Choller?
ha?
Cob. Coller sir? swounds I scorne your coner, I 'sir am no
1345 colliers horse sir, neuer ride me with your coller, and you doe,
ile shew you a iades tricke.

    

Pis. Oh you'le slip your head out of the coller: why Cob you
mistake me. ῃ
Cob. N ay Ι haue my rewme‚ and Ι be angrie as well as ano-
1350 ther, sir. y Α,
Pis. Thy rewme; thy humor man, thou mistakest. 1475 ’ξ’
Cob. Humor? macke, Ι thinke it bee so indeed: what is this ¹ ’
humor? it's some rare thing Ι warrant.
Piso. Marrie ile tell thee what it is (as tis generally receiued

affectation‚ and fed by folly.
Cob. How? must it be fed?
Pis. Oh I, humor is nothing if it be not fed, why, didst thou
neuer heare of that? it’s a common phrase, F eed my humor.

F eed you quoth he? s'blood Ι haue much adoe to feed my sels,
especially on these leane rascall daies too, and't had beene any
other day but a fasting day: a plague on them all for mee: by
1365 this light one might haue done God good seruice and haue ’
drown'd them al in the floud two or three hundred thousand

yeares ago, oh I do stomacke them hugely: Ι haue a mawe nOW,
and’t were for sir Beuisses horse.

Pis.
