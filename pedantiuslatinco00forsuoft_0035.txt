Comedy of Pedantius, acted in our Trinite Colledge in Cambridge n.
But Peacham was a Trinity man.

Messrs Churchill and Keller ¹ argue that Shakespeare had Pedan-
tius in mind when he wrote Love’s Labour Lost and that Holofernes
there represents PedantiuS, and Sir Nathaniel‚ Dromodotus. They
point out that in the folio Holofernes appears almost always as
« Pedant 2³. Ι fail to see any such close resemblance as to convince
me that Shakespeare knew our play ε the prefixing of « Pedant >³ to
H olofernes' speeches instead of his name is only what is found in
similar cases in a number of Italian comedies. However now that
Pedantius is made more accessible, it is open to any reader to form
an opinion on the point which will be just as good as mine.

That Pedantius was known to the authors of the Cambridge
Parnassus plays is a priori probable and there are ⁴passages in the
plays which one may suppose to have been suggested by the
earlier comedy, for example the complaints of the tailor against
his university customers 2 and the exclamation (ε here’s a true

Pedantius 2> 3.

V. SOURCES OF THE PLAY.

When in the winter· of 1580-1581 F orsett or Wingfield or a group
of T rinity men took in hand to produce a comedy for CandlemaS‚
what process did they adopt? Did they invent their play, plot and

all, or did they lay hands on some German or Italian comedy and
transform it to their purposes ? ’

No earlier play has yet been found which bears much resem- ’
blance to the Trinity comedy as produced. The character of the
Pedant, derived ultimately from the Bacchides of Plautus, is

common to a vast number medies, hamt and
the fflast-AE-Lhss-sshafflcter are seen ankQ—i-—n the scholastic
philosopher Dromodotus and the human-ist Pedantlus Pedantius
