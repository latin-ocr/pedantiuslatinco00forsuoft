Clem. Nay gods pretious: and such drunken knaues as 1756
you are come to dispute of Tabaceo once; Ι 113110 done: away
with him.

1660 Cob. Oh good master Doctor‚ sweete Gentleman.

⁵ Lore. Sweete Oliuer, would Ι could doe thee any good;
master Doctor let me intreat sir.

Clem. What? a tankard-bearer‚ a thread-bare rascall, a
begger, a slaue that neuer drunke out of better the pispot met-⁷
1665 110 111 his life, and he 10 depraue, and abuse the vertue of an
herbe, so generally receyu'd in the courts ofprinceS‚ the cham-
bers of nobles, the bowers of sweete Ladies, the cabbins of
souldiers: Peto awaywith him, by gods passion, Ι say, goe too.
Cob. Deare master Doctor.
1670 Loren. Alasse poore Oliuer.
Clem. Peto: 1: and make him a warrant, he shall not goe, I 1769
but feare the knaue. ’
Cob. O diuine Doctor‚ thankes noble Doct'or, most dainty
Doctor, delicious Doctor. Exeunt Peto with Cob.
. 1675 Clem. Signior Loremo: Gods pitty man,
Be merry, be merry, leaue these dumpeS.
Loren. Troth would Ι could sir: but enforeed mirth
<In my weake iudgement) h'as no happy birth.
The minde, being once a prisoner vnto careS,
1680 The more it dreames 011 ioy‚ the worse it fares.
A smyling looke is to a heauie soule,
As a guilt bias, to 3 leaden bowle,
Which (in it s‘elfe) appeares most vile, being spent
To no true vse; but onely for ostent.

“ 1685 Clem. Nay but good Signior: heare me a word, heare me
aword, your cares are nothing; they are like my cap, soone put
on, and as soone put off. What? your sonne is old inough, to “
gouerne himselfe3 let him runne his course, it’s the onely way
to make him a stay’d man: if he were an vnthrift, a ruffian, a

1690 drunkard or a licentious liuer, then you had reason: you had

ξ* reason 10 take care: but being none of these, Gods passion,

and Ihad twise so many cares, as you haue, I'ld drowne them .
