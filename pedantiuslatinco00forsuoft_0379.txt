Euery manin his Humor. [25]

I’st like, that factious beauty will preserue
The soueraigne state of chastitie vnscard,

730 When such strong motiues muster, and make head
Against her single peace? no, no: beware
When mutuall pleasure swayes the appetite,
And spirits of one kinde and qualitie,

Do meete to parlee in the pride of blood.

735 Well (to be plaine) if I but thought, the time
Had answer'd their affections: all the world
Should not perswade me, but I were a cuckold:
Mary I hope they haue not got that start.

For opportunity hath balkt them yet,

740 And shall do still, while I haue eyes and eares
To attend the imposition of my hart,

My presence shall be as an Iron Barre,
Twixt the conspiring motions of desire,
Yea euery looke or glaunce mine eye obiectS,

745 Shall checke occasion, as one doth his slaue,
When he forgets the limits of prescription.

Enter Biancha, with H esperida.
Bia. Sister H esperida, Ipray you fetch downe the Rose wa· 824

750 fast. Exit H esperida.

Tho. By Christ I would not for a thousand crownes.
ι Bia. VVhat ayle you sweete hart, are you not well, speake

Bia. Oh Iesu!

- Bia. Grood Lord how it burnes? M usse keepe you warme, 834
760 good truth it is this new disease‚ there's a number are trou-
’Δ bled withall: for Gods' sake sweete heart, come in out of the
ayre.

D 3 Tho.
