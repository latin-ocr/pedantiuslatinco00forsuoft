and poet Mayster Gabriell Harvey >›. Harvey appeared in the
Eclogues under the pastoral name ‹< Hobbinoll »2

In the spring of 1579 Bridgwater, the Public Orator of the Uni-
versity, was thought to be about to resign his office. Gabriel Har-
vey was away from Cambridge at the time and returned to find
that other candidates were already in the field. Unwilling to lose
his chance of a post for which he might naturally think himself
specially fitted, he solicited a letter in his favour from the Chancel-
lor of the University. He dates his appeal ¹ «pridie Idus Aprilis
(i. e. 12 April) 1579» ; and states in the letter that he had returned
to Cambridge only two days before.

Bridgwater did not vacate his office so soon as was expected23
and though Burleigh wrote as requested on behalf of Harvey‚
when Harvey thanked him ³ « 18 Calend. Julias (i. e. 14 June)
1580 >›, the contest was still to come.

Harvey’s candidature was doomed to disappointment. On¹
16 March 1580s1 he was defeated by Anthony Wingfie1d‚ Fellow
of Trinity. Had VVingfield and his friends contributed to the result
by their ridicule of Harvey a month before in Pedantius ? Harvey
himself attributed his defeat to another cause ε

« I was supposed not vnmeet for the Oratorship of the vniver-
sity, which in that springe of mine age, for my Exercise and credite
Ι earnestly affected ε but mine owne modest petition‚ my friendes
diligent labour, our high Chauncellors most honourable and extra-
ordinarye commendation, were all peltingly defeated by a slye
practise of the olde F oxe >2 (i. e. Dr Perne) 4.

To return to the spring of 1580. The earlier of two letters of H arvey
to Spenser (published three months later'in Three proper letters) is
dated <c e meo municipio... ni fallor, Aprilis septimo, vesperi ».
The letter contained a biting account of the University‚ written in
a moment of exasperation at being outmanoeuvred in the contest 5,

1) Preserved m Lansdowne MSS 2,ss 83. Should the date have been 1580?
⁰) He resigned his office in a letter to Lord Burleigh on 25 001. 1579
(Lansdowne MSS 28, 88).
3) Lansdowne MSS 30, 57.

5) Harvey tells us that the « sharpest part >› was overread at the Coun-
cil table and he was advised to interpret his intentioris in more express
terms, and thereupon made a large apology of his affection to the Uni-
versity‚ which however he suppressed (Grosart Ι. 179, 180.).
