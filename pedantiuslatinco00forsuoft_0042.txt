Pedantius 1; 11131 just as a disease is recognised by the utine, so
the mind is revealed by the face 2; while in thexlast scene he vows
that he is no more surprised to hear that Lydia is dead than « if
one of you were to crack an egg 3 n.

Similarly Pedantius declares that Jupiter will hate the cow Io
before Pallas ceases to love him 4, and tells Lydia that just as a
corpse attracts crows, the scent of her sweetness attracts him, and
that he is fanned by her glance as by the fan of sedition ⁵, while he
finally urges her to be wise before it is too late and as it were gain
wisdom with her gray hairs ⁶.

Pedantius’ condescending air to Lydia is also very humorously
given. When she accepts him, he sayS, « Tibi gratulor, mihi
gaudeo >³ ⁷ and he proceeds to 0311 1161 « mea cornucopia >³ 8 3 word

² which would suggest to the audience more than he meant.

VII. PEDANTIUS AND GABRIEL HARVEY.

We have so far assumed the truth of Nash’s statement that the ‚
part of Pedantius in the play was written to satirize a famous Cam-
bridge character, Gabriel Harvey‚ and that this intention on the
part of the playwright was reinforced by the actor who played
Pedantius and in so doing mimicked Harvey’s smallest peculiarities
to the amusement of the spectatorS. ’

Does the play, as we have it, support Nash’s statement? Messrs
Churchill and Keller 9 seem to doubt that the author of the play at
any rate had any intention of satirizing Harvey. « Dass manchmal
von dem Darsteller auf eine bestimmte, den Zuschauern bekannte Per-
sonlichkeit angespielt wurde, mag wohl sein. So behauptet Nash
a. a. O. Gabriel H arvey sei darin verspottet worden. Andere suchten
andere Portr‘ats zu erkennen 10. Der Dichter hatte wohl haum diese

10) We do not know to what Messrs Churchill and Keller are here

referring unless .it be to the Biographica Dramatica (Baker-Reed-Jones
1812) IV. 438, where we read :—-« Dr Eachard in his Observations on the
Answer to a letter.. of the contempt of the clergy seems to suppose that ⁷
Selden was the object of ridicule in this piece >› (i. e. Pedantius). It is not
clear however that Eachard meant Pedantius by « Selden » (Observations
pp. 65, 66). To us it seems that he was still referring to the play IgnoramuS.
