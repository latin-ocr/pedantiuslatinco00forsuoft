assisted by his slave Crobolus - in defiance of the counsels of his
schoolmaster Pedantius - carried through some love-intrigue with
success, a comedy which ended with the death of Chremulus and
the manumission of Crobolus.

If this theory 1s conect, the playwrights of Ι580-Ι58Ι conceived
the idea which occurred to Queen Elizabeth when she asked to

see Falstaff in love and was rewardedffl pla yoMerry
Wives, and to Bolardo when he based on Pulci’ s M org‘tssMaggwre

 

his Orlando Innamorato The ey determined to Μ the Pedant in

love. This was I believe the root· idea of our play.

ΒιιΙ then came a brilliant after· thought. Would not a pedant in

 

love suggest to a Cambridge audience the luckless Gabriel Harvey, ⁸

Wingfield' 5 ιίν31 for the Oratorship, affl known not more for
his devotion to learning than for '

dious dandyism anekhmnahimssm-pay his tailor. Ρ Leonidas might
now take the place of Spenser, the friend and pupil of Harvey,
who was in favour with the great, and through whom Harvey

had a connexion with the Court. And so Harvey’s phraseS‚
&such {gwere most open to the ridicule of the irreverent, were
put into the Pedant’ 5 mouth, and the actor of the part was instruc·
ted to mimic Harvey’ 5 deportment.

But granting that the evolution of the play in the hands of
Wingfield or Forsett was as we have described, we have only
carried the difficulty one step further back. We have still to find

some original on which was built, not PedantiuS‚ but Pedantius’

 

 

 

, predecessor, Leonidas. The names of the characters -— especially Pog· ’

glostus, Tuscidilla (or Fuscidilla) and Crobolus—excite curiosity. Is
it not possible to show some Italian play or story from which these
names and the elements of the action of the piece were derived?
