and gone to reside with his friends in the North. It would. seem
from the Shepheards calendar, which Spenser published in 1579, that
Harvey had urged him to come south and had apparently been able
to introduce him to Lord Leicester : —-

« Then, if by me thou list advised be

F orsake the soyle that so doth thee bewitch :

Leave me those hilles where harbrough nis to see,

Nor holy-bush, nor brere, nor winding witche :

And to the dales resort, where shepheards riteh

And fruietfull flocks bene everywhere 10566 >›.

Spenser came south in 1578, it would seem : and in Lord Leices-

ter’s house apparently gained the friendship 01 Leicester's nephew,

the brilliant scholar and gentleman, Philip Sidney, with whom

¹ Harvey was already acquainted. Sidney, Spenser and Harvey now
assisted in constituting the so-called « Areopagus » with its meetings
at Leicester house in the spring 01 1579 10 discuss proposals 101
improving English poetry on classica] lines. As we know, Harvey
— who was rather a versifier than a poet — became a devoted
experimenter in English Hexameters.

On 26 July 1578 9116611 Elizabeth visited Audley End, a great
house close to Saffron Walden‚ and 101 a day or two Audley End
became the seat 01 1116 University. Harvey was one 01 11105601105611
10 dispute before the Court, a testimony to the position he held at
Cambridge as a scholar and Latin orator ¹. The disputation took
place in Lord Leicester's chamber under the presidency 01 Lord
Burleigh‚ Chancellor of the University.

In the following September Harvey published four books of
Latin verses, inspired by the royal visit, called Χαῖρε vel Gratulationes

Valdinenses. The separate books had been presented to the 9116611,
10 Lord Leicester‚ to Lord Burleigh, and to Sir Christopher Hatton
respectively.

The verses tell us 01 Harvey's special devotion to «his lord»,
i. e. Leicester‚ and to Sidney. In one poem « De vultu Itali» Harvey
relates that at the time 01 1116 festivities Lord Leicester was about
to send him abroad, and that the 9116611, knowing 01 the design,
when she saw Harvey, asked if he were the man : — « Hiccine,

15 July 1578 ι ‹< The aetors are such as Ι do not doubt but will greatly
commend themselves, and delight the hearers » (H affield Mss„ II p. 188).
