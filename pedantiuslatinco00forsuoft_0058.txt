XLVIII

regius Consiliarius n. Harvey too, as a student of. Civi] Law might
look forward to a career of distinction in the lawcourts. When
Lydia still refuses him, Pedantius changes his tone to vituperation
in truly classica] style. A poem of Harvey's -ζ not however then
published‘i‘f- (Letterbook pp. 111, 112) shows the same transition.

In Act IV Scene III Pedantius' hopes of court-preferment have

g( been dashed, aS‚ according to Nash, Harvey's had been just before
the date of the production of the play, and he threatens to indite

against his enemy « Philippicas nonnullas ad imitationem Ciceronis
& Demosthenis n. He again addresses Lydia in a Ciceronian

oration, in which he says he would follow her to India where he
would dispute with the Gymnosophistae (mentioned by Harvey in
a like connexion in Musarum Lachrymae). He speaks of the cessa·
tion of his court-life as a liberation from toil, but declares he had
received great honour while it lasted : « Me (dum in curia versabar)
praetereuntem demonstrabant omnes digito, insusurrantes Hic est
ille (quod nisi Demostheni olim contigit mortalium nemini) >›. But
did not Harvey boast that the queen had asked « Hiccine, quaeso,
ille est? >³ And then comes another hit at Harvey's boasted acquain-
tance with the fair ladies of the court and of the town : « Ludio. Si
cognosceres ...... quam multae quam bellae sint in aula quae ,istum
appetant virgines (vel foeminae potius)... Concurrebant omnes
undique istum spectaturae. Ped. Et venustate nostra foeminae

forenses captae, tanquam pisces hamo. Sed in medio tot Harpyarum - Ι

honestatem interea custodivi tamen sartam tectam ε quippe qui,
responderim singulis, voluptatem corporis esse belluinam n.
Pedantius is brought to the necessity of selling his books.
Anyone who remembers Harvey's wide reading of Italian and F rench'
as well as classica] authors, or has seen the marginalia which he
added in his beautiful hand to the books he possessed, may detect
a personal allusion in Pedantius’ words —- t< interrogat nunc Pedan-
tius, numquid authores omnis generis exactissim05‚ Graeco& Lati-
nOS, vetereS, neotericos coemere velint hodie. Hos cum satis jam
superque ad contemplativum usum legendO, scribendO, commen·

tando ornaverim, δε annotationibus marginalibus tanquam gemmis ,

There is something traditional and conventional in the relations

portrayed (Act IV Sc V, Act V Sc ΙΙΙ) as existing between Pedantius .’

and his tailor, though they give much occasion for humour, and ’
