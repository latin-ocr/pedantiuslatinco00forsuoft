versation of some of the Gunpowder Plot prisoners overheard in the
Tower‚ while on 6 July 1608 and 18 July 1610 leave of absence is
given to the Lieutenant 01 the Tower on condition that Edw. Forsett
or another should act as Deputy in his absence.

In the first parliament of James I (1603l4 — 161ol1) Edward For-
sett was returned for Wells in Somersetshire in place of Sir Robert
Stapleton deceased. This was probably in the summer 01 1606, as we
find Sir R. Stapleton taking part in the proceedings of the House of
Commons on 6 May 1606, whereas during the last two sessions of
the parliament (18 Nov. 1606 -— 4 July 1607 and 9 Feb. 1609l1o -
23 July 1610) « Mr Forsett» is constantly put on committees for
considering bills after their second reading.

On 8 June 1611 Edward F orsett obtained a grant 01 the manor
of Tyburn or Marylebone. This manor had been leased from the
crown to Sir ’Henry Sidney 101 35 years from Michaelmas 1563, but
Sir Henry Sidney seems to have disposed 01 1115 rights to Richard
Forsett‚Edward F orsett’s father‚as, at the vdate when the lease began,
Margaret Forsett, Richard Forsett's widow, entered into possession.
By letters patent of 3 July 1583 a new lease of the manor had been
granted to Edward Forsett himself for 21 years from Michaelmas
1598 when Sir H. Sidney’s lease expired. Accordingly he was
already lease-holder of the manor when in 1611 it became his own.
After this he lived 101 501110 years at the Manor House, the house
which till 1791 stood on the site now occupied by Devonshire Mews.
The manor remained in Forsett’s family till his descendant John
Austen Esq sold it in 1710.

Various documents from 1583 onwards describe Edward Forsett
as t< of London gent >³ with the variations ι( 01 H olborne near London,
gent» (2 Feb. 1585) ε( 01 the Savoy, 00. Middlesex gent »(1589) but after
1598 110 15 described as ι( 01 Marybone gent». From about 1611 he is
no longer «gent» but «esquire » and «justice of the peace ». The State
Papers show him acting as a justice on 8 May 1620 and 28, March 1621 .

In the midst 01 1115 worldly occupationS, Edward Forsett remain-
ed a scholar. He published in 1606 : A comparative Discovrse of the
Bodies N atvral and Politiqve. By Edvvard F orset‚and in 1624: Α defhnce
of the right of Kings [against R. Parsons] by Edward F orset Esquim·
which would seem to have been written about 1609 when Ρ3150115
was still alive. While these books show that 013551031 and scho-
